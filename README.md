# Hello, I'm [Kathryn Atherton][website]

## I'm a PhD Student at Boston University!
- I'm in the [Bioinformatics](https://www.bu.edu/bioinformatics/) and [URBAN](https://sites.bu.edu/urban/) programs at BU!
- I'm a member of the [Bhatnagar Lab](https://microbesatbu.wordpress.com/)
- I study how urbanization impacts the tree-associated microbiome and how microbes in turn impact the health of trees.
- Fun fact: I love to crochet, sing, and watch sports (Liverpool F.C. are my favorite).
