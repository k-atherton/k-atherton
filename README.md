### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Hello, I'm [Kathryn Atherton][website]

## I'm a PhD Student at Boston University!
- I'm in the Bioinformatics and URBAN programs at BU!
- I'm a member of the Bhatnagar Lab
- I study how urbanization impacts the soil microbiome and how soil microbes in turn impact the health of trees.
- Fun fact: I love to crochet, sing, and watch sports (Liverpool F.C. are my favorite).
